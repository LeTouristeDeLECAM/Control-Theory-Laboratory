Help on function Leadlag_RT in module package_DBR_Advanced :
Lead l ag_RT(MV, Kp, Tlead , Tlag, Ts, PV, PVInit=0, met hod=' EBD'}
The f unct ion "Leadl ag_RT" needs to be i ncluded in a "for or i.hile loop" .
:MV: i nput vect or
:Kp: process gain
:Tlead: l ead time constant [ s ]
:Tlag : l ag t ime constant [ s ]
:Ts : s ampling period [s]
:PV: out put vector
:PVIni t : (optional : default value is 0}
:method: di scret isation met hod (optiona l : def a ult value is 'EBD '}
EBD: Euler Backward diffe rence
EFD: Euler Forward difference
TRAP : Trapezoï dal method
The function appends a va l ue t o the output vector "PV" .
The appended value is obtained from a recurrent equation that depends on the discretisat ion method.

The function "PID_RT" appends new values to the vectors "MV", "MVP", "MVI ", and "MVD" .
The appended values are based on the PID algorithm, the controller mode, and feedforward.
Note that saturation of "MV" within the limits [MVMin MVMax) is impl emented with anti elind -up.
